# Yearly_budget_dashboard.xlsx  
**I have built the interactive dashboard using excel to track budget in each month. The excel file has 3 different sheets**:  
  1. **Raw_data**: I put all my budget of each day and month into this sheet.
  2. **Analysis**: I use Pivot table to do some data analysis.
  3. **Dashboard**: This is an interactive dashboard that summarize the budget I used in each month and total amount of budget in a year.

**What I have learned**: Excel is a powerful tool capable of performing numerous functions, often overlooked by many.
